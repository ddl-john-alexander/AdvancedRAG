Additionally, the operating expenses for FY23 increased by 7% compared to FY22, with research and development expenses growing by 14% and selling, general, and administrative expenses remaining relatively flat.\\n\\nOverall, the decrease in operating income from FY22 to FY23 reflects the impact of changes in net sales and operating expenses on Apple's financial performance during the respective fiscal years.\""
